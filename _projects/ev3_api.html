    Developed an open-source bluetooth API in C for Lego EV3 robotics kits for Fundamentals of Robotics and Automated Systems course. Added functionality to communicate with motors, sensors and the file system by studying developer documentation. Created easy-to-understand documentation detailing the API functionality. The API is currently being used in all hands-on assignments for the course.
