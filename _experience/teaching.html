I have TA'ed the following courses while studying at University of Toronto:
  <ul>
    <li>CSCA08 Introduction to Computer Science (in Python)</li>
    <li>CSCA48 Introduction to Computer Science (in C)</li>
    <li>CSCB09 Software Tools and Systems Programming (shell scripting and C)</li>
    <li>CSCC85 Fundamentals of Robotics and Automated Systems</li>
    <li>CSCD27 Computer and Network Security</li>
  </ul>

  <div> My official duties included:
    <ul>
      <li>Leading tutorials and office hours</li>
      <li>Grading quizzes, assignments and exams</li>
      <li>Updating assignments/labs</li>
      <li>Updating/rewriting auto-markers</li>
      <li>Answering forum questions</li>
      <li>Invigilating tests and exams</li>
    <ul>
  </div>
  
  <div> In addition, to my official duties, I created and maintained a website for many of the courses I taught. For courses, such as CSCB09 that I TA'ed multiple times, I would take on additional responsibilities (helping the instructor with office hours, assisting other TA's with their questions and marking, working through technical issues with the system administrator). I have also volunteered my time to mentor the next generation of incoming TA's.
